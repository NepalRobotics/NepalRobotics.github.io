{"name":"Nepal Robotics","tagline":"Bullis-Kanjirowa STEM Project","body":"# About Us\r\nWe are a consortium of students, academics, and industry leaders working largely on a voluntary basis to develop Unmanned Aerial Systems as tools for the public good. What started out as an educational project has begun to develop into something more <http://nasawatch.com/archives/2015/03/nasa-family-pur.html>.\r\n\r\n## Our Goals\r\nThis project runs along two tracks: first, we wish to experiment with UAS as a platform to aid in search and rescue efforts and, second, we wish to increase engagement with and collaboration about UAS in institutes of learning around the world. To these ends, students at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will be developing an open source project to create autonomous vehicles capable of aiding rescuers in the search for buried avalanche victims in the Everest region of Nepal.\r\n\r\n# Project Information\r\nYou can find some more information about the main project at <http://nepalrobotics.org/>. You can also find the RPI-specific project information at our GitHub documentation wiki: <https://github.com/NepalRobotics/ProjectDocumentation/wiki>. RPI's contribution to the Nepal Robotics Project will be largely independent of the other, ongoing, projects which are more focused on STEM education. Our project at RPI will be focused on developing a practical implementation.\r\n\r\n## Project Background\r\nThe RPI team (still mainly in the recruiting process) will be adapting technologies and research from existing projects:\r\n* <http://students.asl.ethz.ch/upl_pdf/208-report.pdf>\r\n* <http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td3203/32_03-Bamberger.pdf>\r\n* <http://wiki.spench.net/wiki/SDRDF>\r\n\r\n## Project Implementation\r\nAll software written as part of the RPI project will be made available under an open MIT license on GitHub: <https://github.com/NepalRobotics>.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to develop a software and hardware package that integrates a Software Defined Radio direction finding array with a Raspberry Pi and a 3D Robotics Aero UAV. \r\n\r\n![3DR Aero UAV Image](https://3drobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Top.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe core software stack will be written in Python 2.x, and targeted to the open-source [DroneKit](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python) library. \r\n\r\n# Contact Us\r\nIf you are interested in contributing to this project, feel free to send an e-mail to kronmw@rpi.edu or submit a pull request.","google":"UA-68429294-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
